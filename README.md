# fit explorer
Sample application for storing outdoor activities. This application is for me to train my capabilities of implementing geographical features.

It supports decoding from:
  - Garmin .FIT file formtat
  - TCX file format
  - GPX file format
  
I am not very goot at fronted but I've implemented the following pages:

 - /cal.html - calendar with all uploaded activities
 - /region.html - Display a single activity on the map and show charts of recorded heartbeat and elevation
 - /heatmap.html - Show a heatmap of all stored activities

I've used OpenStreetsMap.   
  
  
Postgresql database is used. I've tested it with version 14.1
